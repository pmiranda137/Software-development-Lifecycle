# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs mainly comes from direct communication between potential users and the Product Owner. The rest of the team then reviews the users wishes and creates user stories from them. The user stories are helpful when developing the program because they give a strightforward idea of what is wanted, why, and how the user wants to access it. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs with the anticipation that the requirements for the software could change. The agile proccesses that I hope to incorporate into my future development work are flexibility, adaptability, and communication. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
